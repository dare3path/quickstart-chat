# SpacetimeDB's quickstart-chat, modified for learning purposes.


This is just a modified version of the quickstart-chat example (client+server) from https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/  
  
It's meant to be used with the TLS/mTLS branch from my SpacetimeDB fork located here: https://github.com/dare3path/SpacetimeDB/tree/ssl_for_standalone_server_NOT_in_PR

## Credits
Changes made with the help of xAI's Grok3 and Grok2 because I don't know much of how to Rust or SpacetimeDB. So if things seem wrong, or suboptimal, they might just be.
